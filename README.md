# Nodang - Just talk what you see about!
Nodang is basically a chatting software with synchronized map. 
If you want to show your place to your friends, where you live, where you hang around. how could you explain to your friends? I'm guessing you might use chatting software and you should open google map respectively. Is this map synchronized between users? I don't think so. Please use [Pintalk(https://pintalk.co.kr)](https://pintalk.co.kr) right now! It is on Beta service now.

This is other project that make pintalk with Node.js & react.
